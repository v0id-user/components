# Personal Component Registry

A shadcn registry set of reusable components I developed for personal projects. Open-sourced for anyone who might find them useful.

## About

This repository contains a collection of custom React components built using shadcn/ui. These components have been developed and refined through various personal projects, and are now available for anyone to use in their own applications.

> [!CAUTION]  
> These components were built specifically for my use cases and with the assistance of AI. While they are open-sourced, they might not fit perfectly into all projects. If you encounter any issues or need adjustments, please feel free to open an issue, and I'll do my best to help resolve it.

## Getting Started

Visit the [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) to learn how to use these components in your project.
