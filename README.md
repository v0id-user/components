# Personal Component Registry

A shadcn registry set of reusable components I developed for personal projects. Open-sourced for anyone who might find them useful.

## About

This repository contains a collection of custom React components built using shadcn/ui. These components have been developed and refined through various personal projects, and are now available for anyone to use in their own applications.

> [!CAUTION]  
> These components were built specifically for my use cases and with the assistance of AI. While they are open-sourced, they might not fit perfectly into all projects. All components are in Arabic and support RTL (Right-to-Left) layout by default. If you need English language support or LTR (Left-to-Right) layout, please open an issue, and I'll do my best to help resolve it.

## Getting Started

Visit the [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) to learn how to use these components in your project.
