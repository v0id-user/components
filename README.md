# Personal Component Registry

A shadcn registry set of reusable components I developed for personal projects. Open-sourced for anyone who might find them useful.

## About

This repository contains a collection of custom React components built using shadcn/ui. These components have been developed and refined through various personal projects, and are now available for anyone to use in their own applications.

> [!CAUTION]  
> These components were tailored for my own projects (with some AI help). They default to Arabic and RTL. If you're using English or LTR, open an issue and Iâ€™ll try to help out.


## Getting Started

Visit the [shadcn documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry) to learn how to use these components in your project.
